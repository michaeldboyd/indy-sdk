    "# Apply for a Job\n",
    "\n",
    "At some time in the future, Alice would like to work for the fictional company, Acme Corp.\n",
    "Normally she would browse to their website, where she would click on a hyperlink to apply for a job.\n",
    "Her browser would download a connection request in which her Indy app would open; this would trigger a prompt to Alice, asking her to accept the connection with Acme Corp.\n",
    "Because we’re using an Indy-SDK, the process is different, but the steps are the same.\n",
    "The process of the connection establishment is the same as when Faber was accepting the Steward connection request.\n",
    "\n",
    "After Alice had established connection with Acme, she got the **Job-Application** Proof Request.\n",
    "A proof request is a request made by the party who needs verifiable proof of having certain attributes and the solving of predicates that can be provided by other verified credentials.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, Acme Corp is requesting that Alice provide a **Job Application**.\n",
    "The Job Application requires a name, degree, status, SSN and also the satisfaction of the condition about the average mark or grades.\n",
