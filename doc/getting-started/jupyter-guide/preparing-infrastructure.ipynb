    "## About Alice\n",
    "\n",
    "As a graduate of Faber College, Alice receives an alumni newsletter where she learns that her alma mater is offering digital transcripts. She logs in to the college alumni website and requests her transcript by clicking **Get Transcript**.  (Other ways to initiate this request might include scanning a QR code, downloading a transcript package from a published URL, etc.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Alice doesn’t realize it yet, but in order to use this digital transcript she will need a new type of identity — not the traditional identity that Faber College has built for her in its on-campus database, but a new and portable one that belongs to her, independent of all past and future relationships, that nobody can revoke or co-opt or correlate without her permission. This is a **_self-sovereign identity_** and it is the core feature of indy.\n",
    "\n",
    "In normal contexts, managing a self-sovereign identity will require a tool such as a desktop or mobile application. It might be a standalone app or it might leverage a third party service provider that the ledger calls an **agency**. The Sovrin Foundation publishes reference versions of such tools. Faber College will have studied these requirements and will recommend an **_Indy app_** to Alice if she doesn’t already have one. This app will install as part of the workflow from the **Get Transcript** button.\n",
    "\n",
    "When Alice clicks **Get Transcript**, she will download a file that holds an Indy **connection request**. This connection request file, having an .indy extension and associated with her Indy app, will allow her to establish a secure channel of communication with another party in the ledger ecosystem — Faber College.\n",
    "\n",
    "So when Alice clicks **Get Transcript**, she will normally end up installing an app (if needed), launching it, and then being asked by the app whether she wants to accept a request to connect with Faber.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this guide, however, we’ll be using an **Indy SDK API** (as provided by libindy) instead of an app, so we can see what happens behind the scenes. We will pretend to be a particularly curious and technically adventurous Alice…"

    "## Infrastructure Preparation\n",
    "\n",
    "Faber College and other actors have done some preparation to offer this service to Alice. To understand these steps let's start with some definitions.\n",
    "\n",
    "The ledger is intended to store **Identity Records** that describe a **Ledger Entity**. Identity Records are public data and may include Public Keys, Service Endpoints, Credential Schemas, and Credential Definitions. Every **Identity Record** is associated with exactly one **DID** (Decentralized Identifier) that is globally unique and resolvable (via a ledger) without requiring any centralized resolution authority. To maintain privacy each **Identity Owner** can own multiple DIDs.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this tutorial we will use two types of DIDs. The first one is a **Verinym**. A **Verinym** is associated with the **Legal Identity** of the **Identity Owner**. For example, all parties should be able to verify that some DID is used by a Government to publish schemas for some document type. The second type is a **Pseudonym** - a **Blinded Identifier** used to maintain privacy in the context of an ongoing digital relationship (**Connection**). If the Pseudonym is used to maintain only one digital relationship we will call it a Pairwise-Unique Identifier. We will use Pairwise-Unique Identifiers to maintain secure connections between actors in this tutorial.\n",
    "\n",
    "**TODO -> Show examples or images of what that is here**... \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "The creation of a DID known to the Ledger is an **Identity Record** itself (NYM transaction). The NYM transaction can be used for creation of new DIDs that is known to that ledger, the setting and rotation of a verification key, and the setting and changing of roles. The most important fields of this transaction are `dest` (target DID), `role` (role of a user NYM record being created for) and the `verkey` (target verification key). See [Requests](https://github.com/hyperledger/indy-node/blob/master/docs/requests.md) to get more information about supported ledger transactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Publishing with a DID verification key allows a person, organization or thing, to verify that someone owns this DID as that person, organization or thing is the only one who knows the corresponding signing key and any DID-related operations requiring signing with this key.\n",
    "\n",
    "Our ledger is public permissioned and anyone who wants to publish DIDs needs to get the role of **Trust Anchor** on the ledger. A **Trust Anchor** is a person or organization that the ledger already knows about, that is able to help bootstrap others. (It is *not* the same as what cybersecurity experts call a \"trusted third party\"; think of it more like a facilitator). See [Roles](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1TWXF7NtBjSOaUIBeIH77SyZnawfo91cJ_ns4TR-wsq4/edit#gid=0) to get more information about roles.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The first step towards being able to place transactions on the ledger involves getting the role of Trust Anchor on the ledger. Faber College, Acme Corp and Thrift Bank will need to get the role of Trust Anchor on the ledger so they can create Verinyms and Pairwise-Unique Identifiers to provide the service to Alice.**\n",
    "\n",
    "Becoming a **Trust Anchor** requires contacting a person or organization who already has the **Trust Anchor** role on the ledger. For the sake of the demo, in our empty test ledger we have only NYMs with the **Steward** role, but all **Stewards** are automatically **Trust Anchors**.\n",
